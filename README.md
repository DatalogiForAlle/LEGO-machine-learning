# LEGO-machine-learning
Project in cooperation with The LEGO Company to bring advanced machine learning and reinforcement learning functionality to the LEGO Mindstorms platform.

# Swing Robot
This robot uses an evolutionary algorithm to learn how to swing. The motion was learned in 8 hours, over 75 generations with a total of 600 children evaluated. Demonstration of the results:
