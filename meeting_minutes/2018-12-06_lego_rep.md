- Lego rep very impressed by progress achieved in just 3 weeks
- Goals outlined by LEGO:
  - project in scope of early exploration by LEGO education
  - in cooperation with multiple universities and companies
  - objective is to teach basics of reinforcement learning to school children 
  - to suit the classroom setting, experiments should be quick to conduct (<45 min)
  - distributed learning / learning by multiple identical robots in parallel to speed up learning is one way of achieving this
  - "low barrier to entry, high ceiling"
  - requiring some coding experience to conduct experiments is acceptable.
